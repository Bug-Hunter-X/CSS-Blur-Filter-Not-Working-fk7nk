# CSS Blur Filter Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue where the CSS `filter: blur()` property doesn't produce the expected visual effect. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a corrected version.

## Problem

The blur effect is not applied correctly, possibly due to conflicting styles or improper implementation.

## Solution

The solution involves addressing potential conflicts and ensuring the `filter` property is correctly applied and not overridden by other styles.
